                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project was born out of a need to streamline the process of tracking operational plan
                    achievement and keeping up with timelines and related evidences. It includes dynamic dashboards,
                    automated email notifications, and consolidation of all related departments into comprehensive and
                    insightful dashboard reports.</p>

            <section id="problem-statement">
                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>Tracking the progress of operational plans carries a lot of bad reputation: it's invasive, too
                    demanding, and it's often already too late when the QA officer sends you reminders about the
                    progress of the actions you are supposed to work on. Add to this all of the distributed paperwork,
                    spreadsheets, and emails throughout different departments and with different people.&nbsp;</p>
            </section>
            <section id="methodology">
                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Utilize the power of Google Spreadsheets and the extensibility of custom scripting using Apps
                        Script.</li>
                    <li>Created spreadsheets for each department and a spreadsheet that is able to process data from
                        different departments. This allowed admin users to centralize the distribution of actions easily
                        and make amendments when needed.</li>
                    <li>Building on this, a comprehensive and dynamic dashboard was included to closely allow admin
                        users to monitor the progress of each department, each action category, and even monitor user
                        access to the individual sheets.</li>
                    <li>There is a yearly feedback form that is sent to all OPMS users to suggest improvements or
                        communicate opinions about the system.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="key-findings">
                <h3>Key implemented services</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individual Operational plan actions tracker for each department with relevant dashboards, an
                        easy-to-use tool to upload evidence for each action, and links to user manuals.</li>
                    <li>Automated reminder emails to be sent only to departments that have upcoming deadlines and urge
                        them to work on their actions or communicate with the management if they need further support.
                    </li>
                    <li>Easy disbursement of actions to departments, as well as centralized provision of access
                        permissions to users.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Gathering resources: Intensive discussions with QA Head and staff about the workflow and
                        figuring out the most efficient way given the available resources.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Task management: A simple Google Spreadsheet to manage to-do lists.</li>

                            cases&nbsp;</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Solution: This has been a learning experience and while I worked together with the team
                                to identify edge cases, we still found some along the way and that was ok because this
                                system is flexible, takes less time to update, and deploys instantly once a fix has been
                                incorporated.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The institution found value in the system and gave me the space to improve on it, and became the
                        exclusive reference for Operational Plan information</li>
                    <li>It provided timely insights that directed actions by the QA office when managing issues or
                        delays.</li>

                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>While I wasn't sure about what I wanted to build in this system, I started thinking about the
                        impact it could have on QA operations if they had a system like that, so I put in the effort to
                        plan for the system and learn business logic along the way.</li>
