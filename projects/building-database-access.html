                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project demonstrates a practical SaaS solution built on Microsoft Access that prioritizes ease
                    of use, effective and relevant dashboards; serving a direct and time-sensitive need for the client
                    in managing their scattered databases and operations.</p>

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>Institutions--especially government--often have limitations on applications or solutions that they
                    can build fast because of the formalities involved in asking a third party to build custom apps for
                    a client--especially in the government sector.&nbsp;</p>

            <section id="methodology">
                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Took time to learn basic operations from the target users (staff) in the department</li>
                    <li>Went over available documentation that outlines the processes that need to be automated, stored,
                        and processed.</li>
                    <li>Analyzed the available workflows and potential areas for optimization</li>
                    <li>Developed a comprehensive and progressive solution that aims to provide valuable insights and
                        help staff organize their operations.</li>
                    <li>Implemented an agile methodology where I integrate continuous feedback from the target users to
                        make informed decisions about the features I build.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Incorporated dashboards to give overview stats and in-depth insights</li>
                    <li>Easy update of client information through workshop attendance, verification, and contextual
                        information about them (institution, number of workshops, and any activities they've gone
                        through).</li>
                    <li>Customized and ready-to-print reports that are dynamic to the requested data.</li>

                <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Challenge: Lack of familiarity with the VBA Scripting language</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Solution: Used this project as a learning opportunity and utilized GenAI tools (like
                                ChatGPT) to learn along the way and experiment with features and syntax</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Challenge: Scattered user data across spreadsheets and emails</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Solution: Used data analysis and data cleaning strategies to come up with a unified list
                                and started feeding it to the system early on. I made changes as I go and when the data
                                is available.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Project Impact</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The staff, now that they can see a concrete and practical application that manages their data,
                        gave them insights on how they can further improve their workflow and optimize it.</li>
                    <li>The created databases through this system are usable and scalable to bigger applications in the
                        future (it uses SQL in the backend).</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Focusing on the value of a product instead of how popular it is.</li>
                    <li>Value of employee feedback in shaping effective and value-added applications</li>
