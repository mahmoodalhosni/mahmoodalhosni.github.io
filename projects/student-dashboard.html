                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project utilizes custom APIs created in Google Sheets to extract required student body data
                    into the Google Looker's database. The end result: a dynamic, self-updating dashboard ready to be
                    used by college admins and decision makers.</p>

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>Student data was everywhere, but everything was in isolation. This meant that it's very hard to make
                    decisions like future recruitment, student services, utilies and so on without having hard data
                    showing growth or decline in areas of interest.</p>

            <section id="methodology">
                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A quick survery of the institution's digital infrastructure revealed that there is a lack of
                        unity and centralization of data. This meant I need to establish a pipeline that gathers
                        relevant data to be used on a dashboard.</li>
                    <li>The decision to go with Google Looker was simply because it was within the local ecosystem and
                        it had robust data wrangling and processing.</li>
                    <li>I also created custom Apps Scrippt API to talk to data warehouses to bring in the data (SIS,
                        spreadsheets, and other local data) and then use them to display content on the Google Looker
                        dashboards. I also set up Cron jobs to control when the API is triggered to refresh the
                        datasets.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="key-findings">
                <h3>Key implemented services</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I created 4 pages to organize the data displayed into "themes": Enrollement Stats, Student
                        profiles overview, APL Stats (Accreditation of Prior Learning), and Progress Stats to track
                        students' journey from the first year till graduation.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Development:</b> I worked with Apps Script for custom functions and for the API, along setting up
                        Google Looker using UI features.</li>
                    <li><b>Gathering resources:</b> This mainly happened on Google Spreadsheets to centralize my work.</li>
                    <li><b>Task management:</b> Used Google Spreadsheets to keep track of todo lists and tasks.</li>

                <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Challenge: Different staff reported difficulty using the dashbaord</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Solution: I held one-to-one meetings to understand current needs. I went back and
                                improved on the interface, and included some instructions and explanations to help with
                                ease of use and readability.</li>
                        </ul>
